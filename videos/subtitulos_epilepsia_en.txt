Today, we will learn about epilepsy, a common neurological condition that affects millions of people worldwide.

00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,000
What is epilepsy?

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:18,000
It is a neurological disorder that causes seizures, episodes characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the brain.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,000
There are various types of seizures.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:31,000
Generalized seizures affect both hemispheres of the brain, while focal seizures affect only one part.

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:40,000
The causes of epilepsy are varied: they may include genetics, trauma, brain infections, or strokes.

7
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:49,000
To diagnose epilepsy, studies such as an electroencephalogram are performed.

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:56,000
Treatments include antiepileptic medications, and in some cases, surgery.

9
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:03,000
With appropriate treatment, many people with epilepsy can lead full and active lives.

00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:11,000
If you have epilepsy or know someone who does, remember that support and understanding are essential.
